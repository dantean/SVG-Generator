## Credit Where Credit Is Due

- Thanks to instructor Phil Loy for going over this assignment, I did the majority of it based on his example. 
- Super special thanks to my favorite AI companion, ChatGPT, for correcting my syntax errors, writing the changes to allow the user to set the desired filename, and for getting me to unnecessarily change `const` functions to `import` and then back again because doing that broke everything
